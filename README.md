# SQL Projects

This repository is dedicated to showcasing all the SQL projects Iâ€™ve worked on during my data analytics learning journey. Each project represents a key step in developing my skills in querying, analyzing, and managing data using SQL. Through these projects, I have explored various techniques for extracting meaningful insights from datasets, optimizing queries for performance, and applying SQL in real-world scenarios. I will continue to update this repository as I further expand my knowledge and take on more challenging projects.
