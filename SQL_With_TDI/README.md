# SQL with [TDI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thedata-initiative-tdi/)

In this folder you will find all the SQL projects I did throughout my journey to learn about data analytics with [TDI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thedata-initiative-tdi/). In each project, you can find approximately two files, one for the SQL QUERIES and the documentation for each project, and you can find more details about each week's task on my LinkedIn profile.
